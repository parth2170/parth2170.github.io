A good amount of my time is spent appreciating the capabilities and applications of statistics and artificial intelligence. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in differnt domains of machine learning like Recommender Systems, Anomalous Sound Detection, Segmentation in Satellite Imagery etc. I aim to work towards making deep learning more interpretable and use it to solve some real-world problems in my country.

We propose a novel framework VASG (Visually Aware Skip-Gram) for learning user and product representations in a common latent space using product image features. Our model is an amalgamation of the Skip-Gram architecture and a deep neural network based Decoder. Here the Skip-Gram attempts to capture user preference by optimizing user-product co-occurrence in a Heterogeneous Information Network while the Decoder simultaneously learns a mapping to transform product image features to the Skip-Gram embedding space. This architecture is jointly optimized in an end-to-end, multitask fashion. The proposed framework enables us to make personalized recommendations for cold-start products which have no purchase history. Experiments conducted on large real-world datasets show that the learned embeddings can generate effective recommendations using nearest neighbour searches.","tags":["Recommender Systems","Skip-Gram","Representation Learning","Image Features","Heterogeneous Information Network"],"title":"Visually Aware Skip-Gram for Image Based Recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parth Tiwari","Yash Jain","Anderson Avila","Joao Monteiro","Shruti Kshirsagar","Amr Gaballah","Tiago H.

The first system uses a nearest neighbour graph to construct clusters which capture local variations in the training data. Anomalies are then identified based on their distance from the cluster centroids. The second system uses i-vectors extracted from mel-band spectra for training a Gaussian Mixture Model. Negative log-likelihood values are then used as anomaly scores. Both systems have been submitted to Task-2 of the DCASE 2020 Challenge and show significant improvement over the baseline AUC scores, with an average improvement of 6% across all machines. An ensemble of the two systems is shown to further improve the average performance by 11% over the baseline.","tags":["Anomaly Detection","Signal Processing"],"title":"Modulation Spectrums and i-Vectors for Anomalous Sound Detection","type":"publication"}]
